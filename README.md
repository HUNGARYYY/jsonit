# jsonit

## About
Scraper that takes images from a sub-reddit's JSON data and uses Sinatra to display them in a feed. Images are linked to the individual reddit post/discussion.

## Instructions
Update json location in app.rb on line 12, URL must include json link. For example, the default is the "Le doot generation" sub-reddit. "https://www.reddit.com/r/ledootgeneration/.json"

^C== Sinatra has ended his set (crowd applauds)

## TODO
Will be updating soon..
